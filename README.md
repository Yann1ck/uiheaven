# Melding.Amsterdam

One-page mobile website project using Node.js, Postgresql and Pug/Jade. The website is meant for people who receive unwanted advertisement leaflets in their mailbox and want to report this to the municipality (Gemeente Amsterdam). The app uses WebRTC in order to gain access to the users' camera.

#### Demo (adjust browser window for mobile view):

## Site

Once a user gets to the landing page he/she gets asked for permission to turn on the camera (on mobile). The button/arrow at the bottom will take the user down the page to the camera view. Taking a photo will take the user down to a view where the photo taken is shown and a form to fill out. If the user is not happy with the photo, he/she can retake the photo by click the "Opnieuw" button, which will take him/her back up the page to the camera view.

## Database

Once a user filled out the form, the data gets stored in a PostgreSQL database so that the data + photo is available to whomever might need the data (in this case Gemeente Amsterdam)
